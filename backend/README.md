this simple api returns the names of the three starters pokemon in JSON format.

Building the simple API with NodeJs and Express::

-> install the NodeJs software, it is a powerfull platform that lets you run javascript on your shell similar to how you'll run python.

-> And check the following two commands to display the versions of Node installed and NPM. (NPM is the Node package manager and is a tool for installing, uninstalling, and maintaining package module for your app)

-> initialize a new app.

-> the basic node app contains a .js file and a package.json file.
    (this package.json describe the app)

-> open up your cmd in the folder you want to create your app in and type (npm init) to interactively create your package.json file.

->  It also required you to install the express tool. Use the command for install express (npm install express --save)


How to run the project::

->Run the file node app.js

->the file runs on the port 8006

->run the url " http://localhost:8006/api/pokemon" in your browser then we get three pokemon names in JSON formate.

-> And work on the same url in PostMan app.
